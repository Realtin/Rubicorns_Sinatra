# Show me the Sparkle
Sinatra Project that I'm working on in the Rubicorns Group

Based on the [Suffragist Rails Girls Tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/sinatra-app/)

###Idea
I have tons of Indie Eyeshadows from [Shiro](http://shirocosmetics.com/), [Hello Waffle](http://hellowafflecosmetics.com/), [Fyrinnae](http://fyrinnae.com/) and others.
It's been getting difficult for me to keep track of them and to choose which ones to wear.
With 'Show me the Sparkle' I want to add all my Eyeshadows to a database and let the tool generate suggestions on what to pair together.

###ToDo
* complete the Form
* store pictures?
* Styling  use [Material Design](http://materializecss.com)
* use Sqlite or some other DB
* Authentication / User Login
* add the eyeshadow sugesstion system
* Tests!!!!
